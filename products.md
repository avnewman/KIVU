## Proposed Geophysical Network
<img src="/KIVU/assets/images/Prop_map_sm.png" alt="Network Plan" class="floatRight500">
At the right is the originally proposed seismic, geodetic, and magnetotelluric installation plan as it was proposed.  Proposed sites are shown atop of a black-and-white SAR Interferogram highlighting the deformation driven by a significant rifting event between the Nyairigongo Volcano and Lake Kivu, and crossing between populated areas in the DRC and Rwanda.
