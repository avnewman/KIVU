### Date: 
August 2022
### Activities: 
In early August, after retrieving our field equipment from Rwandan customs, we provided a one-after training exercise with seven students from the East African Institute for Fundamental Research ([EAIFR](https://eaifr.org/)).  Afterward, five of the students were able to travel into the field with our team to learn more about details of the project and how to perform installation of thee continuous GNSS sites.  Photos below are from two of the sites.

The students traveled 4-hours (each way) from Kigali to the Lake Kivu region to learn about how GNSS works, and the types of measurements we make in the field.  The student received hands-on training on the installation of such sites, including optimal site selection, balancing scientific interest, with structural integrity, security, access, and sky view.

Shown here are sites NYBA (top of page) being installed on a water tank at the local hospital, KMBR (just above) being installed atop a small structure behind another hospital, and site BNZA (left). The last is looking down from the site, which sits atop a new community center, looking back at water tank and other local governmental buildings.

One of these students is now in the graduate program of project PI, Cindy Ebinger at Tulane.
