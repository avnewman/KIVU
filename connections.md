## Collaborations and International Connections  associated with the Kivu Geophysics Project

Over the term of the project, the US-based field teams have very much enjoyed significant interactions
and on-the-ground support from our colleagues at the Rwandan Mining Board ([RMB](https://www.rmb.gov.rw/)) and the Rwandan Environmental
Management Agency ([REMA](https://www.rema.gov.rw)).  Too, we've appreciated logistical support and training opportunities provided by
the East African Institute for Fundamental Research ([EAIFR](https://eaifr.org/)).  Our RMB collaborators have been helpful in providing
on-the-ground field expertise during siting and maintenance of seismic, geodetic, and magnetotelluric sites.  REMA
has been helpful with providing facility spaces at the REMA lab located on Lake Kivu, and providing a research vessel
for lake-going activities, including instrumenting Iwawa Island.

Each of the first two years, while establishing geophysical sites in the field, the US-team has shared our scientific
efforts with collaborators and students at EAIFR.  In the third year (2024) of the project, we were able to offer a dedicated
2-day long exercise in [Geodetic Training for Volcanic and Tectonic Processes](2024training).  This activity was attended by
approximately 20 people, including representatives from RMB, REMA, the Rwandan Space Agency ([RSA](https://space.gov.rw/)), 
the Rwandan Ministry of Emergency Management ([MINEMA](https://www.minema.gov.rw/)), the Congolese Goma Volcano Observatory ([OVG-GVO](https://ovg-rdc.cd/)), and students from EAIFR.
