# Website for the Kivu Geophysics project

site is accessible [here](https://avnewman.github.io/KIVU)


### adding images
It seems that for many of the assets that are included (e.g. images), the page is pointing
to the main site (avnewman.github.io) rather than the kivu site, which is linked under the main (avnewman.github.io/KIVU).  To get around this, for these, I need to put in the fully qualified URL to point to the assets location for KIVU.

e.g.
```
 src="https://avnewman.github.io/KIVU/assets/images/logos/KivuLogo.png" 
```
